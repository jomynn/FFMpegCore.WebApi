# FFMpegCore.WebApi

**FFMpegCore.WebApi** is a feature-enhanced project built on the foundation of [FFMpegCore](https://github.com/rosenbjerg/FFMpegCore). It provides a web API for video and audio processing tasks, making it easy to integrate FFMpeg functionalities with JSON-based requests and responses. 

This project allows users to merge videos, add audio, extract audio, and more, with output files available as downloadable URLs.

## **Features**

### **Core Functionalities**
- **Video Processing**: Merge multiple videos, add subtitles, or overlay audio tracks.
- **Audio Processing**: Extract or replace audio from video files.
- **Logging**: Track render jobs with detailed logs.
- **Downloadable Outputs**: All processed files are accessible via unique URLs for easy downloading.

### **Enhanced Capabilities**
- **Authentication**: Secure API access with JWT-based user login.
- **API Keys**: Access endpoints using API keys for automated workflows.
- **Webhook Support**: Receive notifications when processing jobs are completed.
